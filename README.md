### What I learned


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css {
    position: fixed;
    inset: 0;
    margin: auto;


```i-credit img 
    width: 30px;
    height: 30px;
    transform: translate(-20px, -20px);


```i-credit .border 
    border: 2px solid;
    border-radius: 50px;
    border-color: white;
    width: 30px;
    height: 30px

```
### Continued development

Next time i want to focus on learning more coding with css and make it more clean and also to learn how to do more things which i didn't do on this project (hovering view on image)
